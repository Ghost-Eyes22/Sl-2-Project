  <h2> The Story </h2>
  <p3>Takes place in an alternate version of Earth where the age known as The Golden Age of Pirates occurs. The previous Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, left behind the treasure known as The One-piece before being executed by the world government (mostly populated by the Marines). Luffy was only 7 years old when he ate the human-human model Nika, or the gum-gum fruit. The Gum-Gum fruit gives Luffy the power to stretch like rubber which he uses to his benefit while going out on his adventure to find the One Piece and be king of the pirates.
